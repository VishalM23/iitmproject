* GPU programming + cryptography
--- The motivation is to build a mutli-precision library. The students would have to implement C code for the algorithms in this PhD thesis. https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~abhij/download/doc/thesis.pdf
The code should at first compile on regular Linux platforms.

.2. Understanding and implementation of the library datatypes as the first step.
